# Band Glamp - Artist Show & Lodging Management
Mod 3 FE Showcase Project

## [View the Deployed Application](https://davidleach724.github.io/band-glamp/)

## Overview
Tired of trying to get ahold of your tour manager while you're on the road and they're back at home enjoying a nice dinner with their family and all you want to know is where you're playing and if there is enough gas in the mini-van to get you there?? Band Glamp solves the problems of juggling different emails to find out important gig and lodging information by compiling all the data in one spot! This application allows the artist to add gig info and also search nearby National Park Campsites so that THEY TOO can enjoy a temporary glamping vacation.
